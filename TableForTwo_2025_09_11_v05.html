    Working as a restaurant hostess the last five years, Genevieve had become exceptionally proficient at discerning the relationships between the strangers that approached her podium each night. Business colleagues, friends, family, lovers. Two grandparents, their daughter, the son-in-law, and their three unruly children whom the grandparents wished experienced more discipline day-to-day. A boss and his sycophantic underling coming to drink heavily and mouth off on their associates. A group of friends, but one of whom is pining after the unavailable and aloof ringleader.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    On this particular evening, Genevieve saw one of the more subtle and difficult dynamics to pick out. One that could easily be confused as a romantic couple to the untrained eye. But her years at the restaurant had helped her see all the signs: the greeting in a hug that threatened to linger a half-second too long. The quick, yet deep scanning of the eyes. And the easy rhythm of walking side-by-side. Two people who are resisting falling back into the warmth and familiarity of something that once was. Lovers who have come back together after a long long time.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    The man reached Genevieve first and muttered something in broken French. Over the din of the bustling street-side restaurant, he was unintelligible. It may well have been that the last time he spoke French was when he and this woman still shared a life. Seeing Genevieve’s lack of comprehension, the woman stepped in asking for “
    <em>
     une table á deux
    </em>
    .” The man dug his hands in his pockets in a very American ‘aw shucks’ manner. Here they were, likely repeating a well-trodden routine from yesteryear.

   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    Once they were seated, Genevieve couldn’t help but feel a tug at her heartstrings at the tragic tableau before her.
    <em>
     Better to have love and lost than never loved at all
    </em>
    , Genevieve thought to herself. But, as for so many, the aphorism didn’t give her much comfort.

    As Liam studied the menu, Jacquelyn studied his face. The years had been kind, but they did show. Even in their late twenties, he had had a baby face. Now that face had crow’s feet and a thin line running across his forehead. Her heart ached a little at the thought that she had not been there when those lines formed. And how she wouldn’t be there when more arrived.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    On their second date (or was it the first?), they had gotten ice cream. The only other customers in the store were a couple seemingly in their eighties. Still in the delicious throes of that early, fiery love, she allowed herself to pretend that this couple was them, momentarily unstuck from time, visiting the same ice cream parlor year after year.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    The delusion fell apart when she remembered the very circumstances that had brought them together. That chain of events, to which they owed everything, also spelled their doom. They would never grow old together.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    <em>
     Maybe it didn’t have to be that way.
    </em>
    No. She could not put hope in such a dangerous place as that. The present was the only place where her thoughts were safe.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    Easier said than done. Hours later, when he had walked her to the door of her flat, they kissed for a very long time. Everything in her body urged her to invite him inside, but she couldn’t. At least for now. When the kissing ended, they embraced for even longer. It was then that the uncertainty of the future reared its ugly head in her mind. She buried her face in his neck seeking protection from the thoughts. She muttered, “This is going to hurt a lot,” straight into his collarbone. He must’ve heard because he squeezed her even tighter.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    That night as she fell asleep, her last thoughts were on that horribly trite saying,
    <em>
     better to have love and lost than never loved at all.
    </em>
    Despite her distaste for the adage, she had to concede that it must be the logic under which she was currently operating. But might a love be too short, and the pain of the loss still so great that one might be better for having never loved at all? If ever there were an exception to that conventional wisdom, Jac was surely living it now.

    All the patio chairs and tables had been stacked and put away. All except one set. The table for two still hosting the ex-lovers. As hostess, Genevieve had long since completed her obligations for the evening, but she found herself walking to where Jorge, the waiter, was leaned against the counter, smoking a cigarette.

   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    She took up a spot next to him wordlessly, simply enjoying his presence. They both pretended not to watch the couple seated before them.

   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    The chime of a passing bicycle bell pulled Liam out of his conversation with Jac long enough for him realize the staff were waiting for them to close out. He beckoned to the waiter for the check.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    “Completely lost track of time,” he said sheepishly to Jac. She nodded, “Me too.”
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    He could talk to her all night. He’d always felt that way, even up until their last night together. Though, at the time, they hadn’t known it was the end.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    It had been in the States. Not her first visit there, not by a long shot, but her first visit there
    <em>
     with him
    </em>
    which felt significant. For years now, his best friends had gathered at the same cabin on a lake upstate at the end of the summer. That year was no exception.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    His friends had adored her. In a way that they had never treasured any of his ex-girlfriends. Everything about this – well, he couldn’t in good conscience call it a ‘relationship,’ but whatever it was, it felt different.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    The last night at the lake, they hadn’t slept. When everyone else had gone to bed, they snuck down to the rickety dock where a hammock was strung just over the end. As they clambered into it, the hammock swung out over the gently lapping water.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    They just held each other – changing orientation or position every hour or so – and talked until the sun rose.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    Hours later, Jac got in the car with Liam’s friend who was heading straight to the airport. He gave her a cursory kiss and hug before they drove off. One week. That’s all it would be. But then one week turned to three. And before weeks could turn to months, it was over. Too complicated. Work, family, friends, finances, passports.
    <em>
     What were they ever thinking?
    </em>
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    Now, Liam regretted everything about that night. What would have been one of his favorite memories was completely marred by the mere fact that it had been the last of so many things for them. If he had known, he would have kissed her more deeply before she got in that car. He would have stroked her hair more often while lying in the hammock. He would have told her how beautiful she looked under the starlight. He would have never let her leave.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    He would give almost anything to have one more night – one more real night, not like this platonic meeting at a restaurant – and
    <em>
     know
    </em>
    that it was the last. Then he could savor every moment of it and be satisfied the rest of his life.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    His friends urged him to ‘get over’ Jac, but over time he found that he preferred to hold the pain close. It became a strange solace to him for, in a way, he was lucky. People went their entire lives without ever feeling a modicum of the heartbreak he carried every day. It took quite a bit of time, but Liam came to accept that heartbreak is not the consequence of a failed romance. It is the only evidence that true love exists. To feel heartbreak is to know that you were in love. And to have loved is to live.
   </p>
   <hr class="border-gray-400 dark:border-gray-600 mx-auto my-12 w-1/4"/>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    The lovers walked off into the night, leaving Jorge to put away the last of the patio furniture and close up.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    “You don’t have to stay,” he told Genevieve.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    “I don’t mind.” She replied.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    Since the day that she started work at the restaurant, she had dreamed about being with the waiter of few words and of soft temperament. But when Jorge had finally made advances to her one Saturday night after closing up, she had rejected him.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    All she had seen in his shining blue eyes as he struggled to ask, “Should we… do you think it’d be alright if I…” was the agony on the other side of it all. Yes, she had been at the restaurant for half a decade, but she would be out of here any day now. She never intended to live in the town where she grew up. And Jorge would never leave. And besides, he was too old and she too young.
   </p>
   <p class="dark:text-gray-200 mb-4 md:text-xl selection:bg-accent-200 selection:text-gray-900 text-gray-800 text-lg">
    But now, as Jorge locked the door to the restaurant, she felt something stir within her. Something about that pair of dinner guests, the nostalgia that seemed to emanate from their table, had affected her. Despite the pit she felt in her stomach, Genevieve thought she might want to feel something like that one day, even if it hurt. Or at least, that if she did, it wouldn’t be such a bad thing after all.
