It bumped the most when he went to go visit Colonel Parker in the hospital after the Colonel's heart attack. It contributed to this effect of Butler seeming like an Elvis impersonator rather than Elivs. When you look back on archival footage, Elvis's hair is often messy and imperfect. Like a human being.\nColonel Parker can write a contract on a napkin?\nNo one knew Colonel Parker wasn't American? He has the strangest accent in the world and Elvis is SHOCKED to find out that he's not from West Virginia.\nChristmas Special\nIs it live?\nAre they filming over hours, days weeks?\nIn what world can you meet with producers of an NBC show in the Hollywood sign, build TWO tv sets in order to fake out your own manager and a couple of ad sponsor execs?\nElvis wanted to fuck his mom?\nWhen Elvis fired his manager –&nbsp;he could have done that the whole time?\nWhat happened with that hound dog on TV? They cut away and say that it was embarrassing, but I have no idea why. The King was well known for conducting all of his LA meetings in Dr. Evil’s secret lair behind the Hollywood sign.\nThe movie depicts Elvis and BB King as personal friends. This is factual and excuses Elvis from any alleged cultural appropriation.\nAs portrayed in Luhrmann’s film, Elvis did in fact want to fuck his mother\nLuhrmann cut around and enhanced music performances to make a two plus hour film from Presley’s limited catalog and numerous incomplete works.\nWhile the movie shows Elvis firing the Colonel on stage at the International, in reality, Elvis did do that, they just left out the part where he murmured to himself, “I guess I could have done that the whole time. Huh?”\nAustin Butler’s Elvis is shocked to learn that Colonel Parker isn’t from West Virginia. In real life, everyone was too embarrassed for Elvis to tell him that his manager with a sorta kinda Dutch accent was actually from the Netherlands. The script, written by Baz Luhrmann &amp; Sam Bromwell and Baz Luhrmann, renders the King as a civil rights activist motivated by the assassinations of President Kennedy, Dr. King, and Bobby Kennedy. This depiction stretched the truth a little as Elvis was only recognized as a civil rights hero when he traveled back in time to stop slavery from ever happening.\nAt one point in the Oscar nominated film, The Colonel drafts a legally binding contract on a cocktail napkin. The filmmakers took some artistic license in this scene as a cocktail napkin would only serve as a preliminary legal document. The terms could not be executed until they were tattooed on Elvis's lower abdomen.

It's weird to have to follow \"I didn't care much for The Last Jedi\" and quickly add the caveat, \"But not because of Rose!\"\nThere must be examples of inclusive casting in fandom properties backed by quality story. Prey\nNot examples, but close: NOPE\nAlien\nTerminator The film and television industry has coalesced around a sense of nostalgia so for the forseeable future, we will continue to see reboots, requels, and remakes of 20th century IP. And there is no way around the fact that 20th century stories were predominated by straight white males. And if we want our stories to be inclusive, and I very much do, we have to figure this out.\nThis is important not just for the sake of noble pursuits like equality and equal access, but because historically, popular mass media stories have demonstrably shifted the needle on public views. Am I saying TV can solve racism? Absolutely not. But if you tell an engaging story that fucking makes sense, audience can't look away. And if you put someone who hasn't historically been at center of those stories there, guess what, you just normalized it one more iota.\nI have to hope that creators like Chibnall are not casting talented actors like Jo Martin out of some cynical diversity quota. I want to believe that they are genuinely interested in expanding their conceptions and their audience's conceptions of what Doctor Who can be. And whether its lack of time, lack of input from relevant parties, they've just missed the mark.\nThis is ultimately a call to action. If you as a straight white male writer are going to move stories like Doctor Who forward with more inclusive characters, then you need to shape up big time, or step out of the way for someone who doesn't look like us to take the reins.\nYou might think fans who get their knickers in a twist over when the TARDIS's chameleon circuit broke or what point in the continuity the Doctor Developed the sonic screwdriver are sad sad people who can just stop watching if they're so upset. While I think fandom has its problems and multimedia corporations bending over backwards to curry favor with them in recent years is more problematic, I love fantasy and science fiction and the number one goal of these genres is to main the audience's suspension of disbelief. When you hamfistedly insert ill-conceived storylines, we can tell, no matter the color of the skin of the person who has been cast to portray these decisions. And to that person, don't we owe them more? Why do we keep putting these talented performers through this nightmare? I'm not saying racist backlash can be avoided. But maybe it wouldn't such a hell-scape if there were a decent story for everyone else to champion.

But the film and character at its center are much more perplexing. Scorsese latched onto Ernest Burkhart, who apparently takes up a much smaller chunk of the book than Tom White. If the goal of the film was to characterize DiCaprio's Ernest as a conflicted anti-hero, one torn asunder by true love for his wife and the temptations of greed, then it failed.DiCaprio plays Ernest as a man who might be so stupid as to be totally ignorant of his Uncle W.K. Hale's (played by Robert De Niro) criminal empire. On the other hand, after a few years of matrimony with Mollie, and following the death of her cousin Millie, Ernest has seamlessly transitioned into recruiting local buffoons to doing \"King\" Hale's dirty work. There is not a moment spared in the film for Ernest to wonder if organizing the murder of his wife's family and friends might pose a problem for the woman he supposedly loves.Scorsese seemed to intend to paint a picture of a man with a love corrupted by the ever-insidious forces of white supremacy. Even as John Lithgow's Prosecutor Peter Leaward forces Ernest, on the stand, to face the facts of the murders he's perpetrated against her family and friends and the fact that he poisoned her slowly for months, Ernest declares that he loves Mollie. He believes this despite his actions that stand in clear contrast to that idea. Racism has led him to this state of cognitive dissonance. That is perhaps the most interesting notion this film presents. But the irony is that while Scorsese intended to show respect and admiration for the Osage people in the process of making this film, that ever-insidious force led him to do just the opposite.A man's greed and innate white supremacy turning him against the love of his life is an interesting story. A man's greed and innate white supremacy turning him into a sociopathic killer is an interesting story. Killers is caught betwixt and between. And to make matters worse, based on interviews, the filmmakers think that this movie is about Lily Gladstone's Mollie. While Gladstone's performance hits every melancholic note with pitch perfect tone, she is not centered in this story. The structure of this film positions her as Ernest's victim-to-be, slowly, passively waiting for death to come to her from the place she dares not to expect. Scorsese even ends the picture with her obituary. The final scene is a true crime radio broadcast summarizing the rest of the story. The part of a based-on-a-true-story film we’re used to seeing as white text over black. One can assume he means to use this format ironically, to show that this story should and must transcend pulp fascination. Instead, it only undermines his point. At the end of the day, Scorsese chose to show nearly every detail of the grotesque crimes perpetrated against the Osage people. And he chose to center it around a man he made out to be far more complex than he likely actually was. Scorsese himself appears on screen, stirred by the obituary he reads of Mollie Burkhart. But given everything that leads to this moment over 3 hours and 20 minutes, the tears in his eyes can’t help but read a little as the crocodile variety.De Niro says \"they won't remember,\" a meta commentary on the way this story will be forgotten in U.S. history. But further into his justification for Ernest taking the fall, he gets at this idea that people don't really care. It's the cementing of a problematic idea at the heart of this film that people know what kills them, but they don't do anything about it. The Osage as depicted in this film know that \"the white man's food\" will give them diabetes, but they eat it anyways. They know that white men keep marrying their daughters and their daughters keep dying but they do it anyway. They know that King Hale cashes life insurance policies on them and cashes out, yet they trust him anyways. They see the wolves, standing center frame in the picture, but they do nothing. The film wanted to show the horrific blatant nature of these crimes, but in doing so, unfairly depicted the Osage as willfully and woefully ignorant people.\nCan you see the wolves in this picture all the way to people don’t really care\nErnest is caught between being naive, sociopathic, capable of a cognitive dissonance heretofore unseen it might have been an interesting character, but it feels like Scorsese going out of his way to humanize a man from history who Occam’s razor dictates simply saw Mollie Burkhardt and her family as subhuman and treated them worse than that “It’s just to slow her down” he tells himself Scorsese ends the picture with true crime radio broadcast summarizing the rest of the story.

But after thinking over it, I'm wondering if the movie has something much more profound going on. If Reagan-era America can be criticized for falsely propping up the economy with junk bonds and creating this hyper-commercialized culture, then maybe the movie is about the generation of teens in the 1980s who have been handed a raw deal by their parents' generation. It's a movie both literally about death from dreams and figuratively about the death of the American dream.It's implied that the parents of the four children targeted in the film were among those who formed the mob that hunted down and killed Krueger, who by the way, was let off by a failure in the legal system. Now, years later, Krueger has come to reap what those parents have sowed. Krueger's origin story is a reflection of the anxieties that the short term gains of electing Reagan and the rapid economic growth that came with it will lead to a much much greater pitfall, screwing over the next generation.The movie also pointedly contains no depiction of a \"functional\" family. Tina's mother's concern for her daughter's nightmare that opens the film is interrupted by a menacing looking boyfriend who wants her to return to bed. Tina's mother also sports some welts on her face, presumably from this man. After Tina's death, the cops say they try to reach her, but we never see the mother return from Vegas and grieve her daughter's death. In fact, the only funeral we do see is for Rod. It's attended by his friends and their parents, but there is no indication that Rod even has a family. Nancy's parents meanwhile are split up. Her father is too absorbed in his work to heed Nancy's warnings about Krueger, even using his daughter as bait to catch Rod. Her mother is too absorbed with the other end of a wine bottle (portrayed with a borderline hilarious level of cliché) to do the same. Glen's parents purport to be the most typical caregivers in the film, but their overly protective instincts lead directly to his death.Now, back to the ending. Nancy seemingly defeats Krueger in the real world by turning her back on him and refusing to give him power (through her fear of him). It's a surprisingly earnest and logical solution to a villain who seems to embody chaos and absurdity. Of course, that solution is immediately yanked back with the subsequent scene which in hindsight, reads as the most terrifying one in the movie. Nancy's mom sees off her daughter as she joins the rest of her friends in a sweet new convertible. Everyone is manic and comments on a morning fog that will surely burn off soon. The convertible's roof triggers on its own and it is patterned with Krueger's signature sweater stripes. The kids scream and cry for help from Nancy's mother who smiles and waves vacantly just before Krueger's claws reach out through the front door and pull her inside.The movie seems to be saying fears exist for a reason. You cannot just turn your back on them, for if you do, you will have only accomplished making yourself ignorant to your fate. It's a bleak message, but then again so were the 1980s if you took the time to look just below the surface.\nBeyond a pointy-headed analysis of the deeper meaning of the film (which may not even be there), I also want to shout out the movie's juxtaposition of absurdist dream-logic horror and nauseating real-world consequences, which was deeply unsettling. Somehow seeing Tina torn apart on the ceiling of her room or Glen rendered into human mulch is even scarier having been preceded by Krueger waving his six foot arms or licking Nancy through the phone. It's said over and over that comedy and horror are two halves of the same coin. Structurally, both rely on setting up tension and the releasing that tension. Elm Street effectively employs both to amplify its desired result.\n","aliases":["\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" Review"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#film-review"],"headers":[{"heading":"<code>= choice(this.aliases != [], this.aliases[0], this.file.name)</code>","level":1,"id":"`=_choice(this.aliases_!=_[],_this.aliases[0],_this.file.name)`_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"essays/essay_2023_10_30_anightmareonelmstreetreview.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1698722799000,"modifiedTime":1724875906751,"sourceSize":4315,"sourcePath":"Essays/Essay_2023_10_30_ANightmareOnElmStreetReview.md","exportPath":"essays/essay_2023_10_30_anightmareonelmstreetreview.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":5,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"essays/essay_2023_12_06_paddingtonreview.html":{"title":"Essay_2023_12_06_PaddingtonReview","icon":"","description":"Dec 06, 2023 3:42 PMThe most charming thing about this movie is its ability to tell a story through a child's lens without actually tying the point of view to a character.

But to borrow a sub-genre from The Big Picture podcast, it is one of the better \"junk sci-fi\" movies I've seen in a long time.The below-the-line crew on this movie are executing at a high level -- worthy of the predecessor movies in the franchise. The production design, score, costumes, sound design, and creature effects are all immensely affecting.The movie also takes stabs at big ideas. Ideas of creationism, motherhood, and evolution. Nothing mind-shattteringly different than the previous films, but it does go for it and pushes those themes further than they have been pushed before. While it lacks subtlety and -- as one Redditor mentioned in a comment read aloud before the movie started -- class.And this is where things get really interesting. This fourth Alien movie has the building blocks of something great, but then the director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and/or the writer, one Joss Whedon, take big swings. Sure, the movie might be tonally inconsistent, the very premise of the film might be lacking any sort of sci-fi logic to it, but the gains are so so so worth it. The result is a deeply bizarre movie with a couple of authentically depraved sequences that made me hoot and holler from the couch. Nothing seems out-of-bounds for this film. I wouldn't fault someone for being offended by its vulgar and on-the-nose handling of some topics, but it sure entertained me.And here we enter spoilers for the rest of the review.The above alludes of course to the three banner sequences of the film:\n'Number 8' meets 'Numbers 1-7'\nThe birth of the Newborn\nThe death of the Newborn\nWatching Ripley kill her fellow failed Cronenbergien clones was genuinely an emotional sequence in huge part due to Weaver's extraordinary ability to continue to sell this grim universe to us nearly 20 years after she first played the role.Now onto my favorite part of this movie. The Newborn. Before this movie started, I was discussing with my friends the upcoming Alien: Romulus and what we even wanted from an Alien prequel/sequel at this point. Answers were hard to come by. Watching the Newborn rise from the womb of the hybrid Alien Queen, I finally knew. This. This is what I had been wanting. I want to see the Xenomorphs continue to evolve in their nightmarish way.This is the movie's stroke of genius. The hybrid Alien Queen has gained the ability to reproduce directly, like a human. It's presented as a chilling next step for the Xenomorph race. A critical adaptation in their incessant quest to become the greatest most perfect killing machines in the universe. But now that the Newborn is slightly human it loses the edge that all Xenomorphs have -- ruthlessness. The Newborn's first act is to murder its birth mother and then go to Ripley for comfort. It rejects its alien heritage, preferring the more human side of the genetic hybrid coin. The Newborn, like Winona Ryder's Call, wants to ignore the unholy nature of its creation. But while Call and hybrid-Ripley have a future in the ruins of human society, the Newborn is too far gone. It is a monster, just like with hybrid-Ripley 'Number 7,' Ripley decides the only fate it deserves is death.Is Ripley right? I don't know. Where previous Alien movies deal with a simple binary -- human versus monster -- Alien: Resurrection lays out a spectrum where the line between the two binaries is much murkier. And in the spirit of the whole franchise, the pure humans are are more cruel and murderous than the Xenomorphs at the opposite end. In that way, this movie is a fitting conclusion to the Ripley Alien films.","aliases":["\"Alien: Resurrection\" Review"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#film-review"],"headers":[{"heading":"<code>= choice(this.aliases != [], this.aliases[0], this.file.name)</code>","level":1,"id":"`=_choice(this.aliases_!=_[],_this.aliases[0],_this.file.name)`_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"essays/essay_2024_02_17_alienresurrectionreview.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1708227126000,"modifiedTime":1742702685676,"sourceSize":4060,"sourcePath":"Essays/Essay_2024_02_17_AlienResurrectionReview.md","exportPath":"essays/essay_2024_02_17_alienresurrectionreview.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":7,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"essays/essay_2024_09_05_heatreview.html":{"title":"Essay_2024_09_05_HeatReview","icon":"","description":"Sep 05, 2024 7:02 AM![Heat Poster](<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZjNTJlZGUtZTE1Ny00ZDc4LTgwYjUtMzk0NDgwYzZjYTk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg\" target=\"_self\">https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZjNTJlZGUtZTE1Ny00ZDc4LTgwYjUtMzk0NDgwYzZjYTk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg</a>)film-reviewI think I am missing something from this movie. Expectations shape everything and somehow I got it in my head that this was a taut 90-minute action head rush. That's probably thanks to the fact that it's the film that incepted the excellent Rewatchables podcast. But instead, it’s a 2.5 hour, deeply romantic, deeply sensual film about attachment and obsession. That makes for a fascinating film, but when it’s not when you’re expecting it can deflate the balloon a little. There also appear to be numerous apocryphal and legitimate stories surrounding the film that fuel the repeat enjoyment. One that comes to mind is that Pacino is apparently widely known as saying that he interpreted his character as being on cocaine. Learning this story one week after viewing helped his exuberant performance click into place. This is not a new phenomenon by any means, but lacking that context may have also factored into my feeling of being just plain whelmed by this film. The above anecdote from Pacino does prompt a question about what can and cannot be inferred by an audience and whether or not only strictly textual film elements should be considered in criticism.<br>Lastly, it’s always hard to re-calibrate when you’ve seen the derivatives of a work before the primary work. Nolan’s opening of <a data-href=\"The Dark Knight\" href=\"misc/movies-&amp;-series/the-dark-knight.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Dark Knight</a> immediately comes to mind. I rewatched that scene as soon as I finished the movie, delighted to find __ serving as a link between the two movies. Nolan’s sleek opener gets to be so aerodynamic because <a data-href=\"Heat\" href=\"misc/movies-&amp;-series/heat.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Heat</a> is propping it up for so many viewers. And once you’ve seen it, it’s hard to go back to the original with fresh eyes.In short, this movie feels like a prime candidate for a review after my first re-watch where I eat every single one of these words.

I deeply enjoyed spending more time with Celine and Jesse in the subsequent films, but as I watched them, I knew nothing would compare to the experience of spending a whole day and night in Vienna.<br>I can't remember if someone told me this or if I came to this conclusion on my own, but shortly after completing the watch of all three, I proclaimed that while Sunrise was my favorite, eventually I would get more out of <a data-href=\"Before Sunset\" href=\"misc/movies-&amp;-series/before-sunset.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Before Sunset</a>. It's not difficult to understand why someone would think that. If Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke were channeling their own life experiences into these movies, then surely some of what they've gone through is universal. Most people's ideas and understanding of love and romance follow a similar arc. One that is conveniently outlined in these three films.The first time I watched Sunset was the night we put my dog down. Everyone says their dog is the smartest, most human-like animal you've ever set eyes on, but Ruby was really that. She had been having a rough few months and then one morning things took a turn for the worse in a big way. My mom called me and my younger sister and told us to drive home from the university we were both attending at the time. It was an incredibly emotional evening. But also one that fell in the middle of a school week. At the time, I was watching a Linklater movie every week for one of my classes and it so happened that I really needed to watch Sunset that night. I think my nerve endings might have been fried by the loss I felt that night. I think I wanted to resist delving into Jesse's pain of the years with Celine that could have been, and Celine's pain of being confronted with her younger more idealistic self.<br>Much like my late 20s rewatch of <a data-href=\"Citizen Kane\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Citizen Kane</a>, I simply have the life experience now to empathize with the stomach curdling feelings of regret. I also used to get so hung up on romantic relationships working out \"neatly,\" meaning I would flinch if divorce, infidelity, even getting married later in life were ever introduced in the story. You can imagine my dismay then in 2016 when it's revealed late in the film that Jesse has a son with a woman he doesn't love and Celine is dating a war photographer. But today in 2025, it doesn't bother me nearly as much. I suppose that's a helpful development in my path of accepting that my romantic timeline is being constructed differently than I anticipated.","aliases":["'Before Sunset' Review"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#film-review"],"headers":[{"heading":"<code>= choice(this.aliases != [], this.aliases[0], this.file.name)</code>","level":1,"id":"`=_choice(this.aliases_!=_[],_this.aliases[0],_this.file.name)`_0"}],"links":["misc/movies-&-series/before-sunrise.html","misc/movies-&-series/before-sunset.html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"essays/essay_2025_03_23_beforesunsetreview.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1743152148635,"modifiedTime":1743152148635,"sourceSize":2844,"sourcePath":"Essays/Essay_2025_03_23_BeforeSunsetReview.md","exportPath":"essays/essay_2025_03_23_beforesunsetreview.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":9,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"jcu/kst_research_2025_11_11_resurgentalqaeda.html":{"title":"KST_Research_2025_11_11_ResurgentAlQaeda","icon":"","description":"Nov 11, 2025 1:39 PMIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.\nSun Tzu\nBut we know neither the enemy nor ourselves anymore.
